## SAM ANPP Model Analysis

This is a R Markdown file to collect my curated thoughts and outputs
resulting from this project. I am attempting to explore the ability of
various terrestial biosphere models (TBMs) to predict ecosystem
productivity and the role that antecedent conditions of climatic drivers
play in productivity responses.

More incoherent ramblings are saved in a LaTeX document on Overlead -
this file is a summary of my progress.

### P-ANPP SAM Modelling of Sites

The first step was to model the 10 sites from Paschalis et al (2020)
using the SAM approach with precipitation (P) as the only driver. The
key result from this is that only two sites indicate a significant
response of ANPP to antecedent P, as per the below figure

The monthly weights for these two sites offer no immediate information
about which lags are most important - although Konza has more noticeable
spikes than Lahav.
