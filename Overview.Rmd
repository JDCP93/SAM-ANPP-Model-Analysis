## Introduction and Set up

I started by reproducing the results from the Ogle et al 2015 paper. This was successful and the results are available here - https://github.com/JDCP93/SAMCode - although the code and repo are rather chaotic!

I've since moved on to applying the SAM approach to FluxNet data and then terrestial biosphere model simulations across 10 sites (Paschalis et al, 2020). I wanted to explore whether there was any evidence of lagged precipitation or temperature in explaining flux-derived GPP across various FluxNet sites. The aim was to see whether sites exhibited lag effects and whether these were similar across sites or whether behaviour was site/ecosystem specific. With the Paschalis et al data, I wanted to see whether any lags were observed in the ANPP data, and then explore whether a group of 5 terrestial biosphere models captured the observed behaviour. 

As initial exploration, the below SAM model was used:

$ANPP[i]$ ~ $N(\mu[i],\tau)$

where

$\tau = \sigma^{-2}$ and $\sigma$ ~ $U(0,100)$

with

$\mu[i] = \alpha_{1} + \alpha_{2}*PPT_{ant}[i] + \alpha_{3}*Tair_{ant}[i]$

The antecedent terms are modelled as per Ogle et al (2015) with a block structure assigning 9 weights to year 0, 6 to year 1 and 4 to year 2. Monthly sums of PPT and monthly means of Tair were used.

The $\alpha_{k}$ have prior $N(0,0.0000001)$ and the weights have Dirichlet priors.
The model was first run without the Tair term, exploring only the role of antecedent precipitation. Temperature was then added in to assess any changes in the model outcomes.

The repo for this work can be found at https://github.com/JDCP93/SAM-ANPP-Model-Analysis.

## Findings

### Question 1: Assessing Significance of $\alpha_{k}$

For the sites from Paschalis et al (2020), Figure 1 is of the $\alpha_{1}$ term for the model without Tair. The dot is the mean of the posterior distribution for $\alpha_{1}$ and the error bars cover the 95% CI. These are red if the CI does not overlap 0.


```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Covariate terms for 1 year lag (years 0 and -1)', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('plots/P_2_Alphas.png')
```


If antecedent rainfall is now calculated over 3 years (with 4 unqiue weights for year 2), we get Figure 2.

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Covariate terms for 2 year lag (years 0, -1 and -2)', out.width='50%'}
knitr::include_graphics('plots/P_3_Alphas.png')
```

I have two questions arising from this result:

* Is the following statement correct: If $\alpha_{k}$ is significantly different from 0, antecedent rainfall/temperature is a driver of productivity, with importance derived from the monthly weights. If $\alpha_{k}$ is NOT significantly different from 0, the monthly weights have no real meaning.

* When considering a lag of 2 years as opposed to a lag of 1 year, antecedent rainfall is no longer significantly different from zero at multiple sites. This has implications in terms of the choice of lag length - using a longer lag can mask what appears to be possible antecedent effects. Is this behaviour desirable? I believe this occurs due to the Dirichlet prior assigning equal prior weighting to all months. Is there a way of maintaining significance at earlier lags with a different prior assigning higher weights to more recent months or assuming a weight of zero outside of the first year, etc.? 

### Question 2: Understanding monthly weights

Figure 3 is a plot of monthly weights for antecedent precipitation for one site (Shortgrass Steppe). Each plot used ANPP data from various models in the SAM approach and all were found to have an $\alpha_{2}$ that was significantly different from 0.


```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='SGS site weights for various models', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('plots/SGSModelPWeights.png')
```

I have the following questions:

* What statements can be confidently made from these results? It appears that year 0 precipitation has a higher weighting in all models but would the following be a reasonable conclusion? "The TECO and DLEM models assign higher weighting to year 2 than LPX and TC". 
* How can the significance of the weights be assessed? At what point can we confidently state "Precipitation in month i has more importance than in month j for productivity of the site". Is a higher weight enough? Does the CI need to exclude the prior?
* In Ogle et al (2015), the weights are plotted cumulatively and the prior months affecting rainfall are assumed to be all those that occur before the weights sum to 0.9. Is there a reason for preferring this method to the plot above? Similar to question 1, the point at which 0.9 is reached is not independent of the length of lag considered.

### Question 3: The length of data series

Figure 4 is a plot of $\alpha_{2}$ and $\alpha_{3}$ for the sites using observed ANPP as well as each of 5 models. The plots are ordered by length of data available and there is a clear correlation between this and the significance of the $\alpha_{k}$. Red indicates significantly different from 0. Covariate values are normalised about their mean to allow plotting on the same scale.

```{r , echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.cap='Covariates for each model at every site', out.width='70%'}
knitr::include_graphics('plots/ModelAlphas.png')
```

The following question has arisen from this plot:

* Do you have any guidance regarding the length of data set necessary, given the number of parameters being estimated in SAM? The model used here is simple and ideally I would have more processes represented. Additionally, many flux data sets are shorter than 10 years which appears to be the approximate cut off for significance here.
* The model in Ogle et al (2015) as well as other SAM papers (e.g. Ryan et al, 2017) explicitly account for the current year in the variables while also including them within the antecedent term (e.g. the equivalent in my current model would be $\mu[i] = \alpha_{1} + \alpha_{2}*PPT[i] + \alpha_{3}*PPT_{ant}[i] + \alpha_{4}*Tair[i] + \alpha_{5}*Tair_{ant}[i]$). Why is this necessary when the current year's weather is included in the antecedent term with individual weights giving lots of freedom to assigning importance to these measurements?

## Next Steps

When analysing the manipulation experiment data, we'll be working with datasets of <10 years. Depending on the answers to some of the previous questions, the plan is to use methodology such as that from Ryan et al (2017), where I would perform the SAM approach with data at shorter time scales (e.g. daily rainfall rather than monthly, etc.). 

I've also started testing the existing SAM model out-of-sample at the Konza site. This is an attempt to identify the optimal assignment of weights and length of lag - since Konza has such a long dataset (29 years), the results so far are likely to be overfitted. A more in-depth exploration of SAM performance at this site with varying weight setups might hopefully allow us to gather some evidence for the SAM parameters that produce more parsimonious models which can then be exported to other sites/observations.
