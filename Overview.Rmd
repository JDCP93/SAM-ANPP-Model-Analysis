## Introduction and Set up

I have been using the SAM approach (Ogle et al, 2015) to model ANPP/GPP at various sites, first using FluxNet data and then data from Paschalis et al (2020).

As initial exploration, the below SAM model was used:

$ANPP[i]$ ~ $N(\mu[i],\tau)$

where

$\tau = \sigma^{-2}$ and $\sigma$ ~ $U(0,100)$

with

$\mu[i] = \alpha_{1} + \alpha_{2}*PPT_{ant}[i] + \alpha_{3}*Tair_{ant}[i]$

The antecedent terms are modelled as per Ogle et al (2015) with a block structure assigning 9 weights to year 0, 6 to year 1 and 4 to year 2. Monthly sums of PPT and monthly means of Tair were used.

The $\alpha_{k}$ have prior $N(0,0.0000001)$ and the weights have Dirichlet priors.
The model was first run without the Tair term. This was then added in to assess any changes.

## Findings

### Question 1: Assessing Significance of $\alpha_{k}$

For the sites from Paschalis et al (2020), the below plot is for $\alpha_{1}$ for the model without Tair. The dot is the mean of the posterior distribution for $\alpha_{1}$ and the error bars cover the 95% CI. These are red if the CI does not overlap 0.

If antecedent rainfall is now calculated over 4 years (with 4 unqiue weights for year 3), we get the below plot.

I have two questions arising from this result:

* Is the following statement correct: If $\alpha_{k}$ is significantly different from 0, antecedent rainfall/temperature is a driver of productivity, with importance derived from the monthly weights. If $\alpha_{k}$ is NOT significantly different from 0, the monthly weights have no real meaning.

* When considering a lag of 3 years as opposed to a lag of 2 years, antecedent rainfall at Lahav is no longer significantly different from zero. This has implications in terms of the choice of lag length - using a longer lag can mask what appears to be possible antecedent effects. Is this behaviour desirable? I believe this occurs is due to the Dirichlet prior assigning equal prior to all weights. Is there a way of maintaining significance at earlier lags with a different prior assigning higher weights to more recent months? 

### Question 2: Understanding monthly weights

Below is a plot of monthly weights for antecedent precipitation for one site (Shortgrass Steppe). Each plot used ANPP data from various models in the SAM approach and all were found to have an $\alpha_{2}$ that was significantly different from 0.

I have the following questions:

* What statements can be confidently made from these results? It appears that year 0 precipitation has a higher weighting in all models but would the following be a reasonable conclusion? "The TECO and DLEM models assign higher weighting to year 2 than LPX and TC". 
* How can the significance of the weights be assessed? At what point can we confidently state "Precipitation in month i has more importance than in month j for productivity of the site". Is a higher weight enough? Does the CI need to exclude the prior?
* In Ogle et al (2015), the weights are plotted cumulatively and the prior months affecting rainfall are assumed to be all those that occur before the weights sum to 0.9. Is there a reason for preferring this method to the plot above? Similar to question 1, the point at which 0.9 is reached is not independent of the length of lag considered.

### Question 3: The length of data series

The below is a plot of $\alpha_{2}$ and $\alpha_{3}$ for the sites using observed ANPP as well as each of 5 models. The plots are ordered by length of data available and there is a clear correlation between this and the significance of the $\alpha_{k}$. Red indicates significantly different from 0. Covariate values are normalised about their mean to allow plotting on the same scale.

The following question has arisen from this plot:

* Do you have any guidance regarding the length of data set necessary, given the number of parameters being estimated in SAM? The model used here is simple and ideally I would have more processes represented. Additionally, many flux data sets are shorter than 10 years which appears to the approximate cut off for significance here.
* The model in Ogle et al (2015) as well as other SAM papers (e.g. Ryan et al, 2017) explicitly account for the current year in the variables while also including them within the antecedent term (e.g. the equivalent in my current model would be $\mu[i] = \alpha_{1} + \alpha_{2}*PPT[i] + \alpha_{3}*PPT_{ant}[i] + \alpha_{4}*Tair[i] + \alpha_{5}*Tair_{ant}[i]$). Why is this necessary when the current year's weather is included in the antecedent term with individual weights giving lots of freedom to assigning importance to these measurements?
