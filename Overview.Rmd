## Introduction and Set up

I have been using the SAM approach (Ogle et al, 2015) to model ANPP/GPP at various sites, first using FluxNet data and then data from Paschalis et al (2020).

As initial exploration, the below SAM model was used:

$ANPP[i]$ ~ $N(\mu[i],\tau)$

where

$\tau = \sigma^{-2}$ and $\sigma$ ~ $U(0,100)$

with

$\mu[i] = \alpha_{1} + \alpha_{2}*PPT_{ant}[i] + \alpha_{3}*Tair_{ant}[i]$

The antecedent terms are modelled as per Ogle et al (2015) with a block structure assigning 9 weights to year 0, 6 to year 1 and 4 to year 2. Monthly sums of PPT and monthly means of Tair were used.

The $\alpha_{k}$ have prior $N(0,0.0000001)$ and the weights have Dirichlet priors.
The model was first run without the Tair term. This was then added in to assess any changes.

## Findings

### Question 1: Assessing Significance of $\alpha_{k}$

For the sites from Paschalis et al (2020), the below plot is for $\alpha_{1}$ for the model without Tair. The dot is the mean of the posterior distribution for $\alpha_{1}$ and the error bars cover the 95% CI. These are red if the CI does not overlap 0.

If antecedent rainfall is now calculated over 4 years (with 4 unqiue weights for year 3), we get the below plot.

I have two questions arising from this result:

* Is the following statement correct: If $\alpha_{k}$ is significantly different from 0, antecedent rainfall/temperature is a driver of productivity, with importance derived from the monthly weights. If $\alpha_{k}$ is NOT significantly different from 0, the monthly weights have no real meaning.

* When considering a lag of 3 years as opposed to a lag of 2 years, antecedent rainfall at Lahav is no longer significantly different from zero. This has implications in terms of the choice of lag length - using a longer lag can mask what appears to be possible antecedent effects. Is this behaviour desirable? I believe this occurs is due to the Dirichlet prior assigning equal prior to all weights. Is there a way of maintaining significance at earlier lags with a different prior assigning higher weights to more recent months? 

### Question 2: Understanding monthly weights

Below is a plot of monthly weights for antecedent precipitation for one site (Shortgrass Steppe). Each plot used ANPP data from various models in the SAM approach and all were found to have an $\alpha_{2}$ that was significantly different from 0.
