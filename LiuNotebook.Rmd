title: "Replicating Liu et al"
output: html_notebook
---

This notebook is to document my replication of Liu et al's model from their 2019 paper.

I have downloaded the model code from github (https://github.com/yliu11/NEE_Bayes_model, accessed 15/06/20).

I need to coerce data into the required input formats and produce a wrapper script.

## Wkg

I will first attempt to replicate the modelling at one site, Walnut Gulch - US_Wkg.

I need to access the full fluxnet data for this, as the data I have from previous modelling of this site does not include SWC. I need daily FluxNet data
